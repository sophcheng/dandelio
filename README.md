> Your story starter, rooted in D & Elio's story!

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; margin-left: 100px;">
    <img style="width: 100px;" src="assets/images/daniIcon.png" alt = "Mascot Dani (D).">
    <img style="width: 100px;" src="assets/images/elioIcon.png" alt = "Mascot Elio.">
</div>

A simple drawing/writing site, where you can make and (e)mail "postcards" to your friends. My attempt at bringing back letter writing, down to the (very pixelatedly wobbly) brushstroke!

> (Work in Progress)

TODO:
- Save feature for designs/progress
- Implement gacha mechanic for stamp designs (can be saved in scrapbook -- stamps are consumibles)
- Link to email, so created postcards can be sent
- Address drawing when resizing (i.e. mobile devices)
